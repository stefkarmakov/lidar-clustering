# lidar-clustering
The Python file takes in a .bin file with LiDAR data and performs a DBSCAN clustering in order to find the defferent objects present. The script is taylored to data coming from vehicle data, as the ground filtering is based on the premise that the ground is rougly bound to one plane. The clustering is visualized with all clusters/objects having different colors.
